                                    Moving to higher standards brings a lot of excitement to explore the new bee, but
                                    along with it, it also brings responsibilities to make decisions for your career.
                                    Getting into standard 11 is like stepping a stair ahead for your career, but it also
                                    involves you making wise decisions that will pave not just your academics but your
                                    career too.
                                </p>

                                    So, if you have passed your standard 10th and you are ready to take admissions for
                                    standard 11, I guess you might also be confused about choosing streams, what kind of
                                    subjects or courses will be there for a standard 11th, and what all preparations you
                                    need to do before getting into the enrollment for classes. This all can be a little
                                    confusing, but having a good guide will help you pave the path. And, that's what
                                    Sukrishna Commerce Academy stands for. <strong>Sukrishna Commerce Academy</strong>

                                    <h6 class="title">Why Travel to Patna from Gaya?</h6>
                                    <p>I know you might have thought that why to get moved to Patna. So here are a few
                                        pointers which will end up your thoughts.</p>
                                    <div class="inner-content">
                                        <div class="single-wrapper">
                                            <ol>
                                                <li><strong>Convenience</strong> - Travelling from Gaya to Patna is more
                                                    convenient as you have numerous transportation options, such as
                                                    buses, auto-rickshaws, and shared cabs to reach there.</li>
                                                <li><strong>High-Quality Coaching Centers</strong> - The one major
                                                    reason to travel to Patna is for coaching centres that have
                                                    experienced faculty and a proven track record of student success.
                                                </li>
                                                <li><strong>Competitive Environment</strong> - Another reason to commute
                                                    to Patna is for the environment. There are plenty of students who
                                                    commute to Patna or travel there for studying and learning, so this
                                                    can be an advantage as learning between the students will help you
                                                    learn and share information.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Easy Accommodation</strong> - Patna is the major city of
                                                    Bihar, which ensures that you do not have to struggle to
                                                    accommodate.</li>
                                            </ol>

                                                    <p>Sukrishna Commerce Academy started in 2009 with a motive to train
                                                        and guide young generations to help them choose the right career
                                                        path for their future. The academy was started by two CA
                                                        professionals Binay Kumar and Vivek Kumar, with the motive of

                                                    <p>However, the academy was started to provide qualitative education
                                                        to CA and CS aspirants, which later expanded to a coaching
                                                        centre for classes 11 and 12. The academy now provides a
                                                        complete solution for your academic-related doubts with a major

                                                    <p>The academy offers integrated technology learning with a

                                                        than teaching in groups and this made them emerge as the No.1
