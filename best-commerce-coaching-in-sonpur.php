                                    Sonpur, one of the famous towns in Bihar that is commonly known for its largest
                                    cattle fair, is growing with a large student population who are seeking a
                                    qualitative education. The demand for high qualitative courses like that of CA, CS,
                                    and tax-related fields has taken the demand for the student to prefer this course
                                    and build their career in it.
                                </p>

                                    However, increasing the demand towards higher and reputed profiles like CA and CS
                                    has led to rise in the demand for good coaching centres which might be challenging
                                    for the Sonpur students to find due to limited specialized institutes. And, this is
                                    the reason that tons of students every year are commuting to Patna to strive for
                                    good education and opportunities.
                                </p>
