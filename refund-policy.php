        <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
        <p>If you are not completely satisfied with your purchase, we are here to help. Our Refund Policy is
            designed to ensure that our customers have a clear understanding of how refunds are processed and under
            what circumstances they are applicable.</p>

        <h2>Eligibility for Refunds</h2>
        <p>We offer refunds under specific conditions, which are outlined below. If you meet the eligibility
            criteria, we will provide you with a refund or exchange for the services or products purchased:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the service or product purchased was not delivered or if there was a failure in the service.</li>
            <li>If the product purchased is damaged or defective.</li>
            <li>If you cancel your purchase within the time frame stated in the service agreement or terms of
                purchase.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Refunds are not provided in the case of simply changing your mind or if you have violated the terms of
            service or agreed-upon usage of the product or service.</p>

        <h2>Requesting a Refund</h2>
        <p>If you believe you are eligible for a refund, please contact us at [support email] with the following
            details:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your order number or account details</li>
            <li>Reason for requesting a refund</li>
            <li>Any relevant documentation or evidence supporting your claim (e.g., damaged product photo, service
                failure description, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Refund requests will be processed within [X] business days. We may require additional information to
            evaluate your request. Once processed, the refund will be issued to your original payment method unless
            otherwise specified.</p>

        <h2>Exceptions</h2>
        <p>Refunds may not be available under the following circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you exceed the refund request time frame as outlined in the service agreement or terms of
                purchase.</li>
            <li>If the product or service has been used or consumed in a way that is outside of standard usage.</li>
            <li>If the issue or dissatisfaction with the service or product was caused by user error or negligence.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Business Transfers</h2>
        <p>In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your purchase and associated data may be
            transferred as part of the business transaction. In such cases, refund eligibility will still apply
            according to the terms of this policy.</p>

        <h2>Refund Processing</h2>
        <p>Once your refund request is approved, the refund will be processed to your original payment method.
            Please note that it may take [X] days for the refund to reflect in your account, depending on your
            payment provider's processing time.</p>

        <h2>Changes to this Refund Policy</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to update or modify this Refund Policy at any time. Any changes will be posted on
            this page and will be effective immediately upon publication. We recommend reviewing this page
            periodically to stay informed about our refund terms and conditions.</p>
