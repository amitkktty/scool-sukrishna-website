        <h1>Shipping Policy</h1>
        <p>We are committed to providing timely and efficient shipping services to ensure your orders arrive safely and
            on time. By placing an order with us, you agree to the following shipping terms and conditions outlined in
            this policy.</p>

        <h2>Shipping Methods</h2>
        <p>We offer a variety of shipping methods to meet your needs. Shipping costs and delivery times vary depending
            on the method selected and your location. Available options include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Standard Shipping:</strong> Typically arrives within [X] business days from the shipping date.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Expedited Shipping:</strong> Typically arrives within [X] business days from the shipping date.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Overnight Shipping:</strong> Delivered the next business day after the shipping date (available
                for certain locations only).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Processing Time</h2>
        <p>All orders are processed and shipped within [X] business days after receiving your order. Orders placed on
            weekends or holidays will be processed on the next business day. You will receive an email notification with
            tracking details once your order has been dispatched.</p>

        <h2>Shipping Costs</h2>
        <p>Shipping costs are calculated at checkout based on the shipping method chosen and the delivery location. We
            strive to offer the best possible rates while ensuring timely delivery. Free shipping promotions may apply
            under specific conditions, such as minimum order value or location restrictions. These conditions will be
            specified at checkout or as part of promotional offers.</p>

        <h2>Delivery Time</h2>
        <p>The estimated delivery time for your order depends on the shipping method selected and your location. Below
            are the general delivery timeframes for each shipping option:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Standard Shipping:</strong> [X] to [X] business days.</li>
            <li><strong>Expedited Shipping:</strong> [X] to [X] business days.</li>
            <li><strong>Overnight Shipping:</strong> Delivered next business day (for eligible locations).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that delivery times may vary due to factors such as weather conditions, customs processing (for
            international orders), and carrier delays. We are not responsible for delays outside of our control.</p>

        <h2>International Shipping</h2>
        <p>We offer international shipping to selected countries. Delivery times and shipping costs for international
            orders vary depending on your location. Additional customs duties, taxes, or fees may apply upon arrival in
            your country, which are the responsibility of the customer. We recommend checking with your local customs
            office for more details.</p>

        <h2>Order Tracking</h2>
        <p>Once your order has been shipped, you will receive an email with tracking information. You can use this
            tracking number to monitor the status and delivery of your package. Please note that it may take up to 24-48
            hours for the tracking information to update in the carrier’s system.</p>

        <h2>Address Accuracy</h2>
        <p>Please ensure that the shipping address provided during checkout is correct and complete. We are not
            responsible for any delays, lost packages, or extra charges incurred due to incorrect or incomplete address
            information. If an address error is identified before shipment, please contact us immediately to make
            corrections.</p>

        <h2>Lost or Damaged Packages</h2>
        <p>If your package is lost or arrives damaged, please contact our customer service team at [support email] or
            call us at [phone number]. We will work with you and the carrier to resolve the issue as quickly as
            possible. We will issue a replacement or refund for lost or damaged items, depending on the situation.</p>

                Policy</a> page. If you need assistance with returning an item or exchanging it for another, don’t
