                                    Arwal, one of the administrative districts in Bihar, is known for its agricultural
                                    economy and growing educational aspirations. The district has local commerce
                                    coaching centres which might fail to provide specialised training to students who
                                    are looking for proper guidance to grow in their field. However, if you are one of
                                    them, then you need to look beyond the city to attain this. Now, thinking if not
