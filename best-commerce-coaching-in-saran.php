                                                        path for their future. The academy was started by two CA
                                                        professionals Binay Kumar and Vivek Kumar, with the motive of

                                                    <p>However, the academy was started to provide qualitative education
                                                        to CA and CS aspirants, which later expanded to a coaching

                                                        than teaching in groups and this made them to emerge as the No.1
