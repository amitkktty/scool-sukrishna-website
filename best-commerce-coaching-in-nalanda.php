                                <!-- <h6 class="title heingCss pt-4">What is your ultimate dream? CA or CMA? </h6> -->
                                <p class="disc">Nalanda, known for the world-famous ancient Nalanda University, is one
                                    of the greatest attractions for students across different countries. However, in
                                    recent years it has been observed that students are likely to prefer highly skilled
                                    professional coaching centres to equip their knowledge with professional guidance
                                    towards their future. And, commerce being one of the most sought-after streams,
                                    demands a structured approach, conceptual clarity, and mentorship from experienced
                                    educators.</p>
                                <p class="disc">So, if you are aiming to crack CA, CS, CMA, or other competitive
                                    commerce exams, and seeking for the best commerce coaching, then you need to commute
                                    to Patna because Patna is considered to be the preferred destination for commerce
                                    coaching. Let’s dive deeper into the reasons why students prefer Patna for commerce
                                    education and how it can help you achieve your academic and career goals.
                                </p>

                                    <h6 class="title pt-4">Why travel to Patna from Nalanda?

                                    </h6>
                                    <p>The very first point we have is that Patna is the capital and developed of Bihar
                                        which ensures offers a wide range of institutes to offer you the best education
                                        as well best resources and training for the commerce students who are preparing
                                        for CA, CS, CMA, or other competitive exams. And, comparing to Nalanda, it has
                                        fewer coaching options which lacks to provide the needed to the students. So, it
                                        is quite clear that if you are looking to build your career in the field of
                                        commerce then you need to commute to Patna to gain effectiveness in your
                                        learning.
                                    </p>
                                    <h6 class="title pt-4">Distance between Nalanda and Patna</h6>
                                    <p>Nalanda is approximately 30 to 35 km away from Patna. Being well-connected with
                                        Patna routes you can easily get transportation facilities to travel through.
                                        Some of the travel options include as: </p>

                                            around Rs. 80 to Rs. 100.
                                        </li>
                                        <li><strong>Cab -</strong>YAnother transportation facility which you can avail

                                    </ol>
